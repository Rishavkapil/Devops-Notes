### **1. Private Key**

- The **private key** is a secret key that is kept securely on the client machine (your computer or device).
    
- It should never be shared with anyone.
    
- The private key is used to decrypt data that has been encrypted with the corresponding public key.
    
- It is also used to sign data to prove your identity to the server.



### **2. Public Key**

- The **public key** is shared with the server or any system you want to connect to.
    
- It is not sensitive and can be freely distributed.
    
- The public key is used to encrypt data that can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key.
    
- When you connect to a server, the server uses your public key to create a challenge that only your private key can solve, proving your identity.

### **How SSH Keys Work**

1. **Key Pair Generation**: You generate a pair of SSH keys (private and public) using a tool like `ssh-keygen`.
    
2. **Public Key on Server**: You place the public key on the server you want to access, typically in a file called `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
    
3. **Authentication Process**:
    
    - When you attempt to connect to the server, the server sends a challenge encrypted with your public key.
        
    - Your SSH client uses the private key to decrypt the challenge and prove your identity.
        
    - If the decryption is successful, the server grants access.

### **Advantages of SSH Keys**

- **Security**: SSH keys are more secure than passwords because they are much harder to brute-force.
    
- **Convenience**: You don’t need to type a password every time you connect to a server.
    
- **Automation**: SSH keys are ideal for scripts and automated processes that require secure access to servers.

### **Example Workflow**

1. Generate SSH keys:
    
    bash
    
    Copy
    
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
    
    This creates a private key (`id_rsa`) and a public key (`id_rsa.pub`).
    
2. Copy the public key to the server:
    
    bash
    
    Copy
    
    ssh-copy-id user@server
    
    This adds your public key to the server's `authorized_keys` file.
    
3. Connect to the server:
    
    bash
    
    Copy
    
    ssh user@server
    
    The server will authenticate you using your private key.

### **Key Points to Remember**

- **Private Key**: Keep it secure and never share it.
    
- **Public Key**: Can be shared freely and placed on servers.
    
- **Key Pair**: They are mathematically linked; data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key.
    

By using SSH keys, you ensure a secure and efficient way to authenticate and communicate with remote systems.
