Samba is an [open-source](https://techterms.com/definition/open_source) software implementation of the Server Message Block ([SMB](https://techterms.com/definition/smb)) protocol.

Samba is an open-source software suite that enables file and print services between Windows, Linux, and Unix systems over a network.


It allows these systems to share files, printers, and other resources, making it possible for users on different platforms to collaborate and access shared resources transparently.



##### Main Components and Features 

**File Sharing :**  Samba allows file sharing between different operating systems by implementing the server message Block protocol(SMB).



**SMB(Server Message Block )** protocol is a network control protocol used for sharingfiles and other resources between nodes in a network.

It operates of client server mode, where a client sends a SMB request to server to access shared resources and the server responds to share the communication channel.

 It uses port **445** and the TCP network protocol for communication.



**Print Services :** Samba provides print services, allowing printers connected to the Linux and Unix operating systems to be shared with windows clients.
